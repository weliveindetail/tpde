\page tpde-overview Overview

Framework divides back-end into 7 components:
- user-provided IRAdaptor
- Analyzer for computing block layout and liveness information
- base Compiler which drives compilation
- base Compiler for each architecture
- Assembler to handle object file generation/mapping
- user-provided instruction-selection
- encoding snippets generated by the framework from user-provided high-level functions

```

## IRAdaptor:
- user-provided class
- provides functions and definition with which the Compiler can interact with the IR
- this includes a list of functions
- before a function is compiled, adaptor gets a chance to precompute any necessary data structures during compilation
- afterwards adaptor needs to provide an iterator over function arguments, static stack slots,
  basic blocks, PHIs in each block, instructions in each basic block and their operands and result values
- more detailed description in IRAdaptor reference

## Analyzer:
- manages block layout and liveness information for all values
- function analysis done as a first pass before actually compiling the function
- iterates once over the basic blocks provided by the adaptor
- computes block layout mostly according to reverse post-order
- then one pass over all instructions collecting liveness information
- for each value, computes begin and end of its live interval, a refcount and a flag
  indicating whether the value's assignment can be free'd after its refcount reaches zero or whether
  the assignment can only be free'd after the end of the live interval

## CompilerBase:
- main driver of compilation and provides the entry point into compilation [compile()]
- tracks currently active assignments (register information and stack slot for a value)
- contains architecture-independent logic of the register allocation (PHI handling, spilling decisions)
- when compilation starts, it sets up symbols for each function and gives derived compilers a chance to do
  initial setup (e.g. generation of data for global values)
- then proceeds in a per-function manner:
  - notify Adaptor that a new function is being compiled
  - ask analyzer to compute block layout and liveness information
  - setup of static stack slots
  - ask architecture-specific implementation to generate the function prologue and set-up assignments
    for arguments
  - iterate over each block in the order specified by the analyzer:
    - iterate over each instruction in the block as given by the Adaptor and ask the user-provided
	  Compiler implementation to generate the machine code for the instruction
	- free any assignments which are no longer live that could not be free'd when their refcount reached zero

## CompilerBase for each architecture:
- architecture-specific functionality such as prologue/epilogue generation and argument setup
- otherwise, mostly helpers for commonly needed features like spilling/loading registers to/from the stack,
  constant materialization, code generation for (un)conditional branches
  and function call generation
  
## Assembler:
- architecture- and platform-specific; currently only x86-64/AArch64 Linux ELF
- keeps track of symbols and section contents as well as relocations
- also houses unwind and C++ exception table information
- at the end, produces a finished object file or may also be able to map the code 
  directly into memory and do all fixup required to make it executable
 
 
## user-provided Compiler implementation:
- provides architecture-specific information about value parts
  - value may be split into arbitrarily many parts
  - each part has a specific size and register bank
  - each part must fit into exactly one register
- some information for calling convention when dealing with multi-part values
  - can a value be passed in both registers and the stack?
  - does a value have to be aligned in registers?
- most importantly, provides a function to generate machine code for each instruction
- interlude: value assignment tracking
  - value assignments are accessed through ValueRefs which does refcounting using RAII semantics
  - ValueRefs then provide access to individual parts of a value using ValuePart(Refs)
    which can then be used to load them to registers, get their stack frame offset, etc.
  - ValueRefs can also refer to a simple constant, when an assignment is accessed,
    user implementation gets a chance to simply return a constant ValueRef
- machine code generation complexity depends on instruction complexity
- can be as simple as accessing the assignment of the operands and result, loading the operands
  into registers, asking for a register for the result and then emitting instructions
  that implement the semantics of the IR instruction and make sure the result is in the result register
  given
  
## Encoding Snippets:
- since writing down the instruction selection for each instruction is difficult, a lot of work
  and not portable, TPDE includes a tool to generate code that generates a specific sequence of
  instructions given a high-level function
  
- example:
  ```c
  int addi32(int a, int b) { return a + b; }
  ```
  which yields the following machine code
  ```asm
  lea eax, [edi + esi]
  ret
  ```
  
  - the tool will now produce a function that will take two ValueParts corresponding to the two input registers,
    load both to registers, allocate a result register (or reuse one of the input registers if it can be overwritten),
	generate a `LEA` instruction with these registers and return the result register to the caller.
  - conceptually it will look like this:
    ```cpp
	void encode_add(ValuePartRef&& a, ValuePartRef&& b, ScratchReg& result) {
	    AsmReg a_reg = a.load_to_reg(); // make sure a is in a register
		AsmReg b_reg = b.load_to_reg(); // make sure b is in a register
		AsmReg res_reg;
		if (a.can_salvage()) // is the value of a needed later?
		  res_reg = result.alloc(a.salvage()); // can reuse register of a
		else if (b.can_salvage()) // is the value of b needed later?
		  res_reg = result.alloc(b.salvage()); // can reuse register of b
		else
		  res_reg = result.alloc(); // need to allocate a new register
		ASM(LEA32rm, res_reg, MEM(a_reg, b_reg));
	}
	```
  - these function can be generated for multiple architectures and then called from architecture-independent code
  - they can also take expressions that may be fused into memory operands of instructions
  - significantly simplifies implementation of machine code generation
    - instead of having to think about salvaging, loading registers, which instructions to use
	  one can defer to the tool and focus on semantics
	- e.g. instead of having to implement this for addition and subtraction, the implementation
	  for these instructions can be as simple as
	  ```cpp
	  bool compile_binary(IRInstRef inst, BinaryOp op) {
	    IRValueRef [lhs, rhs] = this->binary_ops(inst);
		IRValueRef res = this->inst_res(inst);
		ValueRef lhs = this->value_ref(lhs), rhs = this->value_ref(rhs);
		ScratchReg result{this};
		if (op == BinaryOp::add)
		  this->encode_add(lhs.part(0), rhs.part(0), result);
		else
		  this->encode_sub(lhs.part(0), rhs.part(0), result);
		this->result_ref(res).part(0).set_reg(result);
		return true;
	  }
	  ```
	  which is completely architecture-independent without any regards to the actual instructions
	  being generated
	- extremely useful for fast porting to other architectures and when
	  the necessary instruction sequences are long (e.g. float/double to/from int conversions)
  - currently no support for branching to other basic blocks in the function
	  or function calls
